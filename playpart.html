            The same rooms at the TESMANS'.  It is evening.  The drawing-
  room is in darkness.  The back room is lighted by the hanging
  lamp over the table.  The curtains over the glass door are
  drawn close. <br>

  HEDDA, dressed in black, walks to and fro in the dark room.
  Then she goes into the back room and disappears for a moment
  to the left.  She is heard to strike a few chords on the
  piano.  Presently she comes in sight again, and returns to
  the drawing-room. <br>

  BERTA enters from the right, through the inner room, with a
  lighted lamp, which she places on the table in front of the
  corner settee in the drawing-room.  Her eyes are red with
  weeping, and she has black ribbons in her cap.  She goes
  quietly and circumspectly out to the right.  HEDDA goes up
  to the glass door, lifts the curtain a little aside, and
  looks out into the darkness. <br>

  Shortly afterwards, MISS TESMAN, in mourning, with a bonnet
  and veil on, comes in from the hall.  HEDDA goes towards her
  and holds out her hand.<br>

<br>
MISS TESMAN.
<br>
Yes, Hedda, here I am, in mourning and forlorn; for now my poor sister
has at last found peace.

<br>
HEDDA.
<br>
I have heard the news already, as you see. Tesman sent me a card.
<br>
<br>
MISS TESMAN.
<br>
Yes, he promised me he would. But nevertheless I thought that to
Hedda--here in the house of life--I ought myself to bring the tidings of
death.
<br>
<br>
HEDDA.
<br>
That was very kind of you.
<br>
<br>
MISS TESMAN.
<br>
Ah, Rina ought not to have left us just now. This is not the time for
Hedda's house to be a house of mourning.
<br>
<br>
HEDDA.
<br>
[Changing the subject.] She died quite peacefully, did she not, Miss
Tesman?
<br>
<br>
MISS TESMAN.
<br>
Oh, her end was so calm, so beautiful. And then she had the unspeakable
happiness of seeing George once more--and bidding him good-bye.--Has he
not come home yet?
<br>
<br>
HEDDA.
<br>
No. He wrote that he might be detained. But won't you sit down?
